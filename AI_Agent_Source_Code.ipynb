The flight isn’t great, as the plane has faulty with light and noise. It blinks and make noise for 8hrs non stop! Causing health and sensory issues! Causing Hazard matter to all 3 babies that on bassinet seats. This matters affected 12 passengers and the most horrible flight I ever experience. Have been flying with MAS for more 30yrs and this is the worst! Very disappointed AC not working, just slowly blowing room temperature air. Long taxi time does not help as well. Sweating all over the whole trip. Did not take as cancelled 3 time so took another airline It was a 2-hour flight so they didn't have much time for serving food. There was some turbulence so they could not serve hot coffee or tea for the safety reason. Good service, good tasting food, nice plane, a little bit of delay. The IFE is quite unconvenient if using our own device. Not all passenger brought their own earphone/headphone. Ok, but legspace on MH0127 from Kul to Per was too small. It was not possible to tilt my seat which I don't understand because the seat in front of my could do it. So I didn't rest on the flight. Also, the crew was probably understaffed because it took very long time to take trash after the meal. Everything very different from the flight with Malaysian Airlines from London to KL. Service / food has to be much better. Staff were not very attentive to requests. Requested for a second serve of coke and got a weird look back from the host! Was also told they don’t have extra water bottles when I requested for one before sleep! Dinner time food was very minimum and average. An overnight Doha to KL. Great sleep, good service and tasty food in business class chaos boarding. Crew in business class seemed short staffed and lacking in attention to details initially, but did improve during flight. The flight to GES MNL sucks, there was no entertainment. There was no footrest. So the business class seat was not comfortable. I can't complain. Flying with Philippines airlines was the best choice. They are the best option in the Philippines. Flight left and arrived on time. Preloading area in Manila could use some help. Area needs to be bigger to at least seat the passengers while waiting. Crew is great nonstop to MNL is a game changer. My finger has been hurt by seat, but no answer from you. Great ride! arrived safe and sound. Everything was great altho its still uncomfortable seats too small space to pass through in. Not much legroom in economy seats and aisle. Bathrooms are not maintained well. Staff can be friendlier. Food is barely edible. The PAL employee who assisted my minor children went above and beyond her job and our expectations! Sophia was kind, courteous and made sure my children were taken care of! Service was good but food needs maybe it’s just me Cause I am a foodservice supervisor more menu Sampling to get better quality when packed to be reheated . Vegetables are already dark and over cooked and breaded entrees are not the best choice I guess . All airlines meal service doesn’t appeal To me.Cause this trip I’ve used 4 different airlines and nothing good in all of them food wise. Thanks Overall it’s very acceptable I will gave an A. Food was satisfactory, movie monitor not working. Other than that on time and pleasant crew. Your check in lines were terrible everything else was great! flight cancelled.. booked through orbitz, yet orbitz won't handle refunds.. never use them again.. It arrived 18 minutes early. Attendant are good. For baording , they should improve especially carrying thru bus. Super delayed. Delayed to get the bus, delayed to get off the bus, delayed to take off. exceptionally good with the particular flight because no delay. hope that happens for every flight Boarding had us in a tunnel with no AC for 15 minutes. Not planned well. And you have to pay for water, get at airport Kind of worried due to typhoon but yeah we can't do about nature thing. So okay naman kudos to all crews and pilots for the safe landing. it was good experience though we wait for a minutes in the railday due to no available parking. Keep it up all.. I was memorable! THIS FLIGHT WAS ALL ABOUT WAITING! WAITING TO BOARD SINCE FLIGHT WAS DELAYED. WAITING IN THE RUNWAYS NO AVAILABLE PARKING BAY. FOR THE LAST TIME WAITING FOR FOOD COMPENSATION Can buy food instead of online order. Maybe limit the meal so no waste. The flight was delayed by an hour . Traveling with 75 year old father was difficult and then when he asked for water he was asked to purchase :-) . Overall just an ok experience. Overall service is good, the only thing I would like airasia to improve is there seating. Their seat handles are broken as well as the back rest Boarding with air asia is excellent via organized lines by zone except when there is only 1 gate agent and no scanner, only by tearing tickets??? Crazy The flight was supposed to depart at 9:25. It departed at 9:00. Im glad we were early and did not miss it. They wouldn't even allow us to bring water from the fountain on board the aircraft. Premium seats should have legroom this one didn't have it. I had 2 free checked bag but I got charged for while it shows on my reservation Terrible airline! This airline just ruined our family vacation due to a 12 hours delay as a result of their operational issues. Too many flight delays. Airport terminal serving Boracay needs upgrades. Over 6 hours delayed.. using philippine air fleet planes are beat up dirty and uncomfortable. Have been flying air asia for over 4 years from Manila to Tokyo and kansai as well as several local flights from Manila to Bacolod and Cebu.. 3 planes were down for maintenance and caused havoc.. need to invest in new fleet or seriously clean and upgrade the existing fleet. Will not be flying anymore until fixed. Several options out there now to choose from as air asia prices have skyrocketed.. no point in using them anymore . Severally upset passenger here. They can’t even manage the queuing of Zones for boarding as it’s a crab fest free for all now. No discipline and let the passengers in line to board just run into any lane possible.. and priority luggage?? Forget it I’ve paid for it for the last 6 flights and never got it first.. air asia has turned into a expensive joke.. use Cebu pacific or zip air now.. We had three flight delays before eventually taking off 3 hours late. Inflight service was very limited, but it was a relatively short flight. Luggage was delivered promptly. We recently flew with AirAsia and encountered several issues. Our flight was delayed by over an hour, and both boarding and takeoff were postponed without any prior notification. Although we eventually realized there was a delay on our own, the crew did inform us afterward. To make up for lost time, the pilot took off at high speed, resulting in some turbulent moments that were quite scary. Despite these challenges, the cabin crew did an excellent job managing the situation and easing the inconvenience. Overall, while the delays and turbulence made for a stressful experience, I appreciated the crew’s efforts to keep us as comfortable as possible. I had a wonderful experience with this company. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Our pilot was skilled and clearly experienced. The value for the price was excellent. I would definitely recommend them. Very quick turn around, plane was in good condition, alles paletti. My flight boarding was interrupted as gate staff said I needed visa in advance for Vietnam.... Instead of landing we had to go around and landed in Kuala Lumpur International Airport instead of Subang. Then we had to restart and arrived over 2.5 hrs late As usual, poor communication on delays. No info, no updates, no apologies. Boarding was nuts. Gate change. Delayed. No communication from gate staff. They seemed lost. Rest of the flight went well Premium check in was worth it. Boarding process was a little chaotic. Seats were super cramped and I am less than 80kg and 180cm It was good. The FACE check in at KLIA2 was not working. should remind people who cough must wear the mask. A few persons surrounding keep coughing.
